#This project was inspired by looking at my bank account and wondering,''where all the money was going.''
	
	So, I go to my chase account and download the CSV file

It is usually the the following format:
	
		kind, date, description, amount, how_paid, balance

		Basically we will search for something.  When we find it, we
		will list all the transactions as well as amounts and totals.

		This will give an idea of how much money is spent at say
			Whole Foods
			Trader Joe's
			Gas Station

		This knowledge will help make better descisions and perhaps 
			Save More Money:-)
